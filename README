Validates Email Veracity Of
===========================

Author: Carsten Nielsen <heycarsten@gmail.com>

Validates an email address for well-formedness and verifies it's domain by checking if there are
any mail servers associated with it.


== Options

 * message
   - Changes the default error message.
 * skip_remote
   - Skips the domain lookup.
 * timeout
   - (seconds) Time before the domain lookup is skipped. Default is 2.
 * fail_on_timeout
   - Causes validation to fail if a timeout occurs.
 * timeout_message
   - Changes the default timeout error message.


== Examples

 * validates_email_veracity_of :email, :message => 'is not correct.'
   - Changes the default error message from 'is invalid.' to 'is not correct.'
 * validates_email_veracity_of :email, :skip_remote => true
   - Domain lookup is skipped.
 * validates_email_veracity_of :email, :timeout => 0.5
   - Causes the domain lookup to timeout if it does not complete within half a second.
 * validates_email_veracity_of :email, :fail_on_timeout => true, :timeout_message => 'is invalid.'
   - Causes the validation to fail on timeout and changes the error message to 'is invalid.' to obfuscate it.


== Running The Tests

 * You will need to use a computer with an internet connection to utilize the remote features.
 * To run the validates_email_veracity_of_test you will need to have the plugin installed in a Rails project.
